# Dynamic-Retail-Dashboard-for-Walmart
#Objective
The objective of this project was to create an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze Walmart’s sales performance, profitability, and order trends. The dashboard provides insights into product categories, regions, and customer segments, helping decision-makers identify growth opportunities and improve profit margins.

#Summary of Findings
Total Orders: 51,290
Total Quantity Sold: 1,78,312 units
Total Sales: ₹1,26,42,502
Total Profit: ₹14,67,457
Overall Profit Margin: 11.61%

#Key Insights
Top-Performing Categories & Regions:
Technology category shows the highest contribution to revenue.

#Central and South markets lead in sales volume.

#Profitability:
Profit margins are relatively moderate at 11.61%, indicating potential room for cost optimization.

#Sales Volume Drivers:
A few high-demand products and specific regions contribute significantly to total sales.

#Predictions
Based on the current performance trends:
If sales growth continues at the current rate, annual sales could cross ₹1.5 crore.
Increasing marketing efforts in underperforming regions (e.g., Caribbean, Canada) could improve total revenue by 5–7%.
Focusing on high-margin products within the Technology and Furniture categories could improve overall profit margins by 2–3%.

#Conclusions
Walmart’s strongest performance is concentrated in a few markets and categories, with room to expand profitability by targeting smaller markets and optimizing product pricing.
Improving operational efficiency and focusing on top-selling, high-margin products will be key to driving future growth.
The dashboard allows management to slice and filter data dynamically, ensuring quick, data-driven decisions.
